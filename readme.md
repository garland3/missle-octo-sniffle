# Fun game 

*  can i train an RL to shoot down missles?

## Plan

* make a simple pygame
  * missles come across the screen
  * you have to shoot them down
  * if one gets past, then you loose
  * your score = time till the end. 
* then use some RL library to 
  * play the game. 


```ps
conda activate missle_defense
```
